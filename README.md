# Netbeans Custom Themes
Just a set of themes I decided to port and/or customize for the Netbeans IDE

## Yesterday Evening
This theme is the result of my tentative to port the theme "Tomorrow Night Eighties"
(https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) to NetBeans. I soon realized,
though that it would eventually evolve independently form the original theme and
it maybe already did. :)

The theme is mainly oriented to support the syntax for PHP, (X)HTML, JavaScript
and CSS.

I consider this theme still on a very preliminary stage because there is still
much room form improvement.
