# Netbeans Custom Themes
Just a set of themes I decided to port and/or customize for the Netbeans IDE

## Installation
1.  Get the theme (zip archive) you want to install. You can do that in one of
    the following ways.
    * Download it from the [download page](https://github.com/paololus/NetBeans-Custom-Themes/downloads).
    * Create the archive by yourself.
      In this case make sure you zip the _'config'_ folder within the main
      theme folder itself (e.g. _NetBeans-Custom-Themes/Zenburned/**config**_)

2.  Open NetBeans and import the new theme by:
    `Tools => Options => Font & Colors => Import => Browse...` choose the zip archive
    (e.g. Zenburned.zip) `OK`. Now select the `All` option (to import all the settings)
    and finally `OK` again. NetBeans will prompt a window asking you to restart
    the editor in order for the imported settings to be effective. Just confirm.

3.  Enjoy (if everything is ok) or complain (if somthing wrong happened) =)

## Yesterday Evening
This theme is the result of my tentative to port the theme "Tomorrow Night Eighties"
(https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) to NetBeans. I soon realized,
though that it would eventually evolve independently form the original theme and
it maybe already did. :)

The theme is mainly oriented to support the syntax for PHP, (X)HTML, JavaScript
and CSS.

I consider this theme still on a very preliminary stage because there is still
much room form improvement.

## Zenburned
This is just a port of the famous and great Zenburn theme (http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/).

For the colors palette I referred to this very useful page: http://wiki.steam-punk.net/zenburn.

I dedicated about one hour or so to create this theme from scratch (actually from
the default theme which comes with NetBeans 7.1), and I mainly targeted the PHP
syntax. This means that you will definitely find lots of inconsistencies! =)

Obviously any comment and input is welcome!
